# Impersonator

Record and replay object interactions. Ideal for mocking not-http services when testing (just because, for http, [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) is probably what you want)

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'impersonator', group: :test
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install impersonator
